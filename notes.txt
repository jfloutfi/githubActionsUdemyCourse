workflow automation service by github
CI/CD

continous integration -> integrating new changes to existing code base
continous delivery/deployment

new syntax:
git branch -> allows you to create branches instead of checkout -b
git swicth to swicth branches
git switch -c -> create and switch

git remote add origin url
origin is a name, this can be written as: git remote add someOnlineRepo url
the term origin is just a name (alias) for a remote repository URL.

git remote set-url https://jfloutfi@github.com/jfloutfi/someRepo.git
setting the remote URL like this tells github that when interacting with this repo, assume user jfloutfi
then: git push origin main -> will ask us for a password. This can then be created in settings -> Developer settings -> Personal access toke
make sure to check "repo"
generate the token and copy it
once use locally as a password, the system will store it for future use
use --set-upstream to connect the local branch with its remote conterpart branch

git remote and git remote get-url origin will show us the alias and the url or the remote repo

Pull requests can be created accross forks
once you fork a repo and you push some changes to another branch,
you can then, from the page of the orignal repo, created a pull request from the branch on your fork to the original repo

GitHub Actions
--------------
We can have multiple workflows
workflows can run un parallel

each workflow can have multiple jobs
jobs can run in parallel
jobs can be conditional, for example only run if the previous job succeeds or fails

each job can have multiple steps
steps are sequential
steps can be conditional


The first line must be: "name"
name: my workflow

on: key reserved to define the event to when to trigger this workflow, workflow_dispatch value make sure we can manually trigger this workflow

jobs: below you define the jobs, yml works with indentations
jobs:
    fist-job: // this is the job name, it is not a reseved keyword
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest => search for these online, you will find the list of available runners in github documentation https://github.com/actions/runner-images
        steps: // below we define the steps, each starting with a "-"
            - name: Print greeting
              run: command to run
