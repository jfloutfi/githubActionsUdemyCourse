git remote add origin url
origin is a name, this can be written as: git remote add someOnlineRepo url
the term origin is just a name (alias) for a remote repository URL.

git remote set-url https://mrj997@github.com/mrj997/someRepo.git
setting the remote URL like this tells github that when interacting with this repo, assume user mrj997
then: git push origin main -> will ask us for a password. This can then be created in settings -> Developer settings -> Personal access toke
make sure to check "repo"
generate the token and copy it
once use locally as a password, the system will store it for future use
use --set-upstream to connect the local branch with its remote conterpart branch

git remote and git remote get-url origin will show us the alias and the url or the remote repo
